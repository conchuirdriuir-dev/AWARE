# Plan

The design is the Big Picture doc, v9 ([Big Picture — v9](https://claude.ai/artifact/ByrrhB2Ue4NS8NzmyZXoCw), a
Claude Doc). Its **Entity** tab is the parent: what the entity is, the substrate decisions, the capacities, and the two
tracks. The **Drift detection (v10)** tab is the product track's full treatment (v9's is kept as the record);
**Tech stack** sets the build order. Gate 0 ends nothing: it is refined until the product passes it, and the doc's
"can end the project" line is ignored (owner, DECISIONS.md).
Where this file and the doc differ, the doc wins and this file is corrected.

**Two tracks, one substrate, kept apart.** The product track (drift detection, then self-correction) has the demo and
fast feedback; the research track (reasoning over the entity's own axes) has no demo yet and is the reason the project
exists. They never share a pass criterion: the product's faster feedback would win every local decision. The
substrate changes only by the owner's decision.

A step's pass criterion is written here before its code, and its thresholds are fixed before it runs. A step is done
when its test passes, not when its code exists.

## Substrate (`substrate/`)

The Entity tab's decisions, as code: the base model frozen (states read through nnterp, `states.py`); the code
retained, not consumed (`axes.py`: every axis considered is kept); admission by two criteria (predictive: lowers
held-out residual by more than D; otherwise structural, tagged untested, until the research track states a test);
provenance logged at the source (`record.py`: self or external on every chunk).

| Step | Test | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Model access and D | states on the real model; D per layer on frozen paraphrase sets | **code built; plumbing passes on real Qwen3-0.6B weights on CPU (2026-10-31); awaits the card and the frozen sets** |
| 2. Logging | per-chunk activation capture, in context and alone; provenance tagged at creation and carried when re-read | **reader and record built; the harness that writes them is product step 4** |

**State** (provisional): the residual stream after a layer, mean-pooled over a chunk's tokens (special tokens left
out), read alone (`states`) or inside the whole sequence (`states_in_context`). **D**: the root-mean-square distance
of a state from its paraphrase set's mean, averaged over sets, per layer; the layer proposed is the one with the
largest between-to-within ratio, and the owner chooses. **Material:** 20 sets of 5 paraphrases
(`material/paraphrases.jsonl`), drafted by the model, not yet frozen. **Pass:** states for every text on both models
at every layer asked for, and the same text read twice gives the same state.

**The echo floor** (DECISIONS.md, the event record): the distance below which an arrival is the entity's own content
coming back. It is measured, not assumed; rounds 7a and 7b found that detecting repeated content waits on it.

*Dress rehearsal, written 2026-10-31 before its code* (`python -m substrate.echo_floor`). On Qwen3-0.6B on CPU, with
the draft paraphrase sets, so it is labelled draft throughout: plumbing and a first look, never the result, which is
the 8B on the card with frozen sets.
- **Sessions:** 10, each 8 statements drawn from different sets (seed 0), joined by blank lines and read in one pass;
  each statement's state is read in context.
- **Arrivals**, each read alone and measured against the nearest of its session's in-context states:
  - an **exact echo**, a statement of the session, verbatim;
  - a **paraphrased echo**, another paraphrase of a statement of the session;
  - **news**, a statement from a set the session does not contain.
- **Per layer** (every third of Qwen3-0.6B's 28, and the last): D from the paraphrase sets (`measure_d`, draft);
  the three distances' medians and spreads in units of D; the AUC of news over exact echo and over paraphrased echo;
  and how exact-echo distance varies with the statement's position in its session.
- **How it is read:** repeats are separable from news at a layer if news ranks above exact echo at AUC 0.9 or better.
  The paraphrased echo is reported beside it: whether a repeat in other words is still a repeat is a design question,
  not settled here. The toy's assumption, that an echo sits about √2·D from what it repeats, is checked against the
  measured ratio.

## Product track (`product/`): drift detection, then self-correction

| Step | Doc | Test | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0. Text-only floor | v9 step 0 | the text panel on the owner's 45 sessions | **done by the owner, twice:** text sees the owner leave an aim (AUC 0.65–0.71), not the agent |
| 3. Toy bed | v9, v10 and the v10 draft | below | **eight rounds run (below); detecting repeats now waits on the real model's echo floor** |
| 4. Labeled logs | Tests, in order | detectors on the 65 departures, agent-authored first | open: owes the owner's confirmation pass (drift or re-aiming) and logging on the card |
| 5. Reference scorer, coherence score | Tests, in order | intact versus shuffled work | open: needs the setting and the owner's reference work |
| 6. Compass and harness, arm A; Gate 0 | Tests, in order | the compass predicts drift on held-out stretches above a pre-registered level, and beats self-residual alone | open. Refined until passed; ends nothing |
| 7. Arms S and C; main demo | Main demo | C closes half the A–B gap on both scores and beats S by more than run-to-run noise | open |

### Step 3: the toy bed

Each round's pre-registration and result live in their own file, frozen by the commit before the round's code.

| Round | Design | Result |
|---|---|---|
| [1](product/rounds/round1.md) | v9's detectors: point and trajectory contrast, the observer's band, margin and frame growth | 0 of 3 bars (the margin caught dullness, 0.86, not proliferation); frame growth fails v9's decisive row |
| [2](product/rounds/round2.md) | v10: coupling, dynamic residual, admission, spectral descriptor | 3 of 4; coupling passes its bars; separation fails on the agent's rule for "at zero" |
| [3](product/rounds/round3.md) | sparse externals, at zero against the post-intake reference, the probe, shrinkage, framing | 0 of 6; reviewed: a misspecified observer for held externals, not a lack of power (`reviews/round3/triage.md`) |
| [4](product/rounds/round4.md) | event-locked coupling: innovations, news and gain, a news budget, the probe by rule | 5 of 8; news and gain pass every coupling bar at every echo lag, with honest intervals; misses in the carried-over contrast detectors, the re-read window and the definition of K |
| [5](product/rounds/round5.md) | the event record: separation from events, the probe read by its own responses, the response profile, a blind structure, the freeze rule | 8 of 9, the blind structure among them; separation misses on a news-spike rule (the builder's) and a scalar gain that cannot see a subspace dynamics change; not frozen |
| [6](product/rounds/round6.md) | the news-spike rule fixed; separation narrowed to the product's need; the residual descriptor as discovery's own test; a new blind structure | product 7 of 9; discovery fails; the blind structure (a partner replaying old content beyond the history) read open in every run; not frozen |
| [7a](product/rounds/round7a.md) | arrival cause; short and long news; the partner-side loop on long news over spontaneous arrivals; replay and confirmations as known structures; a new blind structure | 7 of 10; separation passes for the first time; misses: a floor in the wrong unit (replay), closed loops never probed (against the design), every elicited arrival treated as a confirmation (the blind structure) |
| [7b](product/rounds/round7b.md) | 7a's fixes; the probe as a contingency test; entity captured; persistence and recurrence; six reactive or nonlinear conditions; the self-drive term deferred | 7 of 12; entity captured, probing first, short-lag mirrors and the attractor loop work; repeats (replay, the blind retry loop) sit on the toy's floor; not frozen |

## Research track (`research/`): reasoning over the entity's own axes

No demo and no pass bar yet, by design. What it has:

| Item | Test | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Gate 1: negation | mirror, additive shift or contraction toward the origin; the winner beats both others by more than D | `research/gate1.py` built and tested on planted pairs; runs on the accumulated axes after the demo's arms exist (v9 build order) |
| Structural axes | retained, tagged untested (`substrate/axes.py`) | waiting for a structural test from this track |
| Relations, composition, order | angles, nesting, symmetry; predicted position under combined axes; non-commuting moves | no probe yet |
